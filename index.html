                            <p>Regional oxygen saturation (rSO<sub>2</sub>) monitoring systems permit the continuous noninvasive measurement of cerebral regional oxygen balance within the frontal cerebral cortex. Since cerebral rSO<sub>2</sub> represents an adjunct physiologic measure, local microcirculatory oxygen balance, it is important to appreciate the fundamental elements of this infrared light-based technology. This technology offers additional insights into patient clinical status; however, the novelty of the technology also makes it imperative for clinicians to review important situations and limitations that may influence rSO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
                            <p>The non-invasive INVOS<sup>TM</sup> monitoring system is intended for use as an adjunct monitor of regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation of blood in the brain or in other tissue beneath the sensor. It is intended for use in individuals greater than 2.5 kg at risk for reduced-flow or no-flow ischemic states.</p>
                            <p>The INVOS system should not be used as the sole basis for diagnostic or therapeutic decisions however; both randomized and non-randomized controlled clinical trials have shown the positive impact of INVOS-guided patient management on patient outcomes. Compared with standard clinical practice, INVOS monitoring with a standardized interventional protocol has been shown to provide improved outcomes after surgery and resource utilization.<sup>1-4</sup></p>

                            <h4>Brain Oxygen Balance Monitoring with Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)</h4>
                            <p>Intracranial regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation (rSO<sub>2</sub>) measurement by NIRS is possible because the human skull is translucent to infrared light. As with other forms of clinical
oximetry, saturation determination relies on multiple wavelengths of light to discriminate between the unique absorption spectra of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. (Figure 1) Generally speaking, within the wavelength region of interest (i.e., spectrum), the only other competing infrared absorbers (i.e., chromophores) are water and the skin pigment melanin. (Figure 1) INVOS measurements appear to be relatively unaffected by normal skin pigment variation in adult patients; however, pathologic variations in pigmentation or brain water content may influence photon absorption, scatter and the resulting rSO<sub>2</sub> measurement.<sup>5,6</sup></p>

                            <h4>The INVOS™ System</h4>
                            <p>The INVOS system employs disposable sensors with an
                            integrated near infrared light source and photodetector that
                            can be applied to each side of the forehead for monitoring
                            blood in the brain. This placement permits monitoring of the
                            ischemia-susceptible cortical tissue in the border zone
                            between the anterior and middle cerebral arteries but, may
                            preclude detection of posterior border zone oxygen imbalance
                            or perfusion abnormality.<sup>7,8</sup></p>

                            <p>Figure 2 illustrates that the mean path of tissue-reflected
                            photons is parabolic. With an INVOS optode light sourcedetector
                            separation of 4 cm, infrared photons penetrate to a
                            depth of ~2 cm [i.e., (light source - detector separation)<sup>-½</sup>]
                            below the skin surface.<sup>9</sup> Thus, INVOS monitoring measures
                            the outer cerebral cortical layers in adults.<sup>9</sup> The cerebral tissue
                            sample volume is ~1.5 cc.<sup>9</sup> Since there is sufficient photonabsorbing
                            hemoglobin in larger vessels to trap all incident
                            infrared light, surface-detected infrared reflections arise
                            exclusively from blood vessels &lt;100 μm in diameter. Based on
                            recent positron emission tomography (PET) studies, the
                            arterial:venous ratio within this microcirculation appears to
                            be ~30:70.<sup>10</sup> Observations during retrograde cerebral
                            perfusion demonstrated that the INVOS monitor rSO<sub>2</sub>
                            determination is relatively insensitive to substantial shifts in
                            this ratio.<sup>11</sup> In addition, rSO<sub>2</sub> differs from other oximetric
                            technologies such as pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and jugular
                            venous oxygen saturation (SjvO<sub>2</sub>) because it does not require
                            actively flowing blood, pulsatile or non-pulsatile.</p>

                            <p>The INVOS system uses a proprietary process termed spatial
                            resolution to suppress the influences of extracerebrally
                            reflected photons. The optode contains a second infrared

                            <h4>Validation of rSO<sub>2</sub> as a Measure of Brain Oxygen Balance</h4>
                            <p>Compared with other oximetric technologies such as arterial
                            (SaO<sub>2</sub>) and jugular venous (SjvO<sub>2</sub>) oxygen saturation,
                            verification of brain rSO<sub>2</sub> accuracy remains technically
                            challenging. In the absence of a true reference, manufacturers
                            and the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration have adopted a
                            proxy called field saturation (fSO<sub>2</sub>).</p>

                            <p>This metric, k<sub>1</sub>(SaO<sub>2</sub>) + k<sub>2</sub>(SjvO<sub>2</sub>), was developed by an early
                            INVOS system clinical investigator to assess cerebral oximeter
                            performance.<sup>14</sup> The manufacturer-specific constants k<sub>1</sub> &amp; k<sub>2</sub>
                            are empirical estimates of the arterial and venous blood
                            contribution to proprietary rSO<sub>2</sub> algorithms.</p>

                            <p>A peer-reviewed report describes statistically significant
                            correlations between fSO<sub>2</sub> and the INVOS monitor rSO<sub>2</sub> in
                            healthy adults breathing room air as well as hypoxic and
                            hypercapnic mixtures (Figure 3).<sup>15</sup> Without a true reference
                            standard however, regional cerebral oxygen saturation
                            accuracy is indeterminate and the interpretation of device
                            comparisons is complex and uncertain.</p>

                            <p>Clinicians should appreciate that momentary rSO<sub>2</sub> values and
                            trending characteristics are machine-specific and are not
                            interchangeable among different oximeter brands.<sup>16-18</sup> As a
                            result, it is unjustified to use clinical data generated from one
                            proprietary rSO<sub>2</sub> system to “validate” the utility of a
                            competing device.<sup>19</sup></p>

                            <p>Normative brain rSO<sub>2</sub> values are an absolute requirement for
the definition of abnormality. For the INVOS systems, the
normative rSO<sub>2</sub> is 71±6% for conscious healthy adults
(n=44).<sup>15</sup> Edmonds et al. preoperatively determined an
rSO<sub>2</sub> of 67±10% in 1,000 adult cardiac surgery patients
(age 21-91 years, 32% female) (Figure 4).<sup>11</sup> Values &lt;50 were
thus statistically subnormal. A left vs. right hemisphere
asymmetry of >10% occurred in only 5% of patients.
Recently, multiple studies have confirmed both the cardiac
patient normative values and asymmetry incidence.<sup>20,21</sup> It is
noteworthy that SjVO<sub>2</sub> asymmetry >10% occurs in a majority
of patients.<sup>22</sup> Thus, physiologically appropriate comparisons
of rSO<sub>2</sub> and SjvO<sub>2</sub> require that both measurements invariably
be made from the same side of the head.</p>

                            <h4>Pre-procedure (baseline) rSO<sub>2</sub></h4>
                            <p>INVOS monitoring does not require establishment of a preprocedure
                            baseline reference. As with intraoperative blood
                            pressure monitoring however, obtaining baseline information
                            is sound clinical practice.<sup>23</sup> Moreover, pre-procedure bilateral
                            rSO<sub>2</sub> values can alert the clinician to technical difficulties in
                            need of immediate correction or valid pre-existing
                            symmetrical or asymmetrical subnormal values.</p>
                            <p>Collection of reliable baseline rSO<sub>2</sub> values is influenced by
                            proper recording technique. Prior to optode (i.e., disposable
                            sensor) application, patient forehead skin oil should be
                            removed with an INVOS-provided acetone wipe. Oil removal
                            facilitates optimal adherence of the self-adhesive optode to
                            block interference by environmental light. If the forehead is
                            exposed to intense light (i.e., direct forehead illumination by
                            surgical lights) or heat sources (i.e., fluid or body warmers),
                            the optodes should be covered with an opaque material. If
                            practical, the sensors should be positioned above each eye with
                            the long axis parallel to the intra-aural line and the superior
                            optode edge adjacent to the hairline. Consistent positioning in
                            this manner minimizes inter- and intrasubject baseline rSO<sub>2</sub>
                            variation and avoids the potentially confounding effects of the
                            frontal sinus on light scattering.<sup>24</sup> Repeated optode use is not
                            recommended because the accumulation of epidermal debris
                            on the adhesive surface may have unpredictable effects on
                            extracranial photon scattering.</p>
                            <p>Prior to monitoring, INVOS system recording quality should
                            be assessed by inspection of the signal strength index (SSI) for
                            each channel (Figure 5). The 5-unit bar scale is non-linear.
                            Thus, the 1-bar signal strength is only 4% of that represented
                            by 5 bars. Adequate signal strength is represented by the
                            continuous display of >1 bar.</p>

                            accompanying endotracheal intubation provides a simple
                            method to verify bihemispheric normal vascular

blood pressure management may then be used to help
avoid hypoperfusion injury. The individualized CO<sub>2</sub>:rSO<sub>2</sub>
relationships are also important during cardiopulmonary
bypass to optimize acid-base management.<sup>33</sup> With CO<sub>2</sub>-
unreactive cerebral arterioles, the risk of brain hypoperfusion
is increased and the perfusionist has a diminished opportunity

suited for the early detection of developing hypoxemia.
Inspection of the familiar oxygen dissociation curve
emphasizes that venous SvO<sub>2</sub> or venous-weighted rSO<sub>2</sub> will
change more than arterial SaO<sub>2</sub> or SpO<sub>2</sub> to a fixed decline in
blood oxygen partial pressure (Figure 9). This fact combined
with the extraordinarily high brain oxygen demand results in
observation that developing hypoxemia often appears first in
brain rSO<sub>2</sub> (Figure 8).<sup>34,35</sup> Even with the extensive physiologic
monitoring used during cardiac surgery, evidence of
inadequate oxygen delivery may be first observed by a
declining cerebral rSO<sub>2</sub>.<sup>36</sup></p>

                            <p>In its low-to-normal range (i.e., hematocrit &lt;30%),
                            hemoglobin and rSO<sub>2</sub> are linearly related, while at a
                            higher hematocrit, their relationship vanishes or may
                            become inverse.<sup>37</sup> This hemoglobin-dependency explains
                            the oft-observed transient rSO<sub>2</sub> decline at the onset of
                            cardiopulmonary bypass. Initial passage of a crystalloid prime
                            solution through the cerebral circulation momentarily lowers

                            product administration will not invariably result in a rSO<sub>2</sub>
                            increase. Naidech et al. (2008) noted a wide variation in brain
                            rSO<sub>2</sub> responses to administration of packed red cells
                            (Figure 10).<sup>8</sup></p>
                            <p>Occasional declines in rSO<sub>2</sub> should be expected, since stored
red cells may have their oxygen-carrying capacity diminished
by up to 90%.<sup>38</sup></p>

                            <p>Nearly two-thirds of cerebral oxygen is utilized to support
                            interneuronal signal transmission. Thus, anesthetic influences
                            on rSO<sub>2</sub> depend on the neuropharmacologic properties of
                            each agent and its dose. Volatile halogenated anesthetics,
                            barbiturate hypnotics and propofol have profound cortical
                            suppressant activity, while opioid analgesics and
                            benzodiazepine amnestics generally do not. Rising doses of
                            the powerful cortical suppressant anesthetics may increase
                            rSO<sub>2</sub> as oxygen consumption is decreased.<sup>39</sup> Conversely, a
                            sudden rSO<sub>2</sub> decrease may signify decline in anesthetic effect
                            (Figure 11).</p>

                            <p>The neuroprotection afforded by hypothermia, in part, is due
                            to reduced brain oxygen demand. However, individual
                            patient responses to cooling vary widely. Thus, decreasing
                            cranial temperature does not automatically ensure an
                            adequately neuroprotective cerebral hyperoxic state.<sup>40</sup> Wide
                            variation in cooling response is due to patient-specific cerebral
                            hemodynamics as well as mechanical perfusion strategy/
                            tactics.<sup>41</sup> For example, the enhanced cerebral blood flow
                            and cooling efficacy afforded by temperature-corrected
                            (i.e., pH-stat) acid-base management improve neurologic
                            outcome in both pediatric and adult patient cohorts
                            undergoing cardiovascular surgery with deep-hypothermic
                            circulatory arrest.<sup>29,42</sup> Yet, the magnitude of hypothermic
                            neuroprotection in individual patients depends on the
                            bi-hemispheric responsiveness of cerebral arterioles to
                            change in hydrogen ions and CO<sub>2</sub>.<sup>43</sup></p>

                            this key information at the start of surgery to guide patient
                            care plans and optimize hypothermia management
                            (Figure 12).<sup>41</sup></p>
                            <p>Regional brain hypoperfusion associated with suboptimal
                            cooling may lead to transient cerebral vasoparesis
                            (i.e., vasoneural uncoupling).<sup>44,45</sup> As a result, during
                            re-warming an inverse relationship between brain temperature
                            and rSO<sub>2</sub> has been described in both adult and pediatric
                            cardiac surgery patients. Prompt detection and treatment of
                            this flow-metabolism mismatch may help avoid ischemic

                            extended with the use of bilateral rSO<sub>2</sub> monitoring to ensure

                            <p>Hundreds of peer-reviewed studies demonstrate that despite
                            the potential for artifact and other issues, reliable INVOS
                            monitoring rSO<sub>2</sub> values can be obtained in many patient care
                            settings.<sup>51-53</sup> However, in certain circumstances, momentary
                            rSO<sub>2</sub> values may not accurately reflect regional brain oxygen
                            balance. Some of the examples below emphasize the
                            importance of rSO<sub>2</sub> trends in signal interpretation. As noted,
                            INVOS monitoring is an adjunct to clinical judgment, not a
                            substitute for it.</p>
                            <p>Extreme examples of this inherent physiologic limitation are
                            the reports of normative rSO<sub>2</sub> values that were obtained from
                            human cadavers or chromophore-containing inanimate
                            objects like pumpkins.<sup>54,55</sup> Cadaveric rSO<sub>2</sub> values may be
                            normal because post-mortem cerebral venous oxygen
                            saturation ranges widely from 5-95% depending on the
                            cause of death and body storage conditions.<sup>55,56</sup> Similarly, a
                            normative rSO<sub>2</sub> reading may arise from pumpkins because
                            the value depends simply on the spectrophotometric
                            measurement of non-pulsatile reflected light.</p>

                            brain injury from hypoperfusion and oxygen debt. However,
                            cerebral hyperperfusion manifested by hyperoxia is also
                            potentially injurious. Under-perfused brain shifts to anaerobic
                            metabolism for survival. Resulting lactic acidosis dilates
                            cerebral arterioles in affected regions. Consequently, a benign
                            transient hyperemia typically appears with restoration of
                            normal perfusion. For example, after termination of vascular
                            occlusion during carotid endarterectomy or carotid angioplasty
                            and stenting, ipsilateral cerebral hyperoxia (i.e., rSO<sub>2</sub> increase
                            >10%) generally appears within 3 minutes and normalizes
                            within 20 minutes (Figure 14).<sup>64</sup> Alternatively, a pathologically
                            persistent (i.e., >24 hr) hyperemia may produce vasogenic
                            edema and a cerebral hyperfusion syndrome characterized by
                            migraine symptoms, delirium, focal neurodeficit and seizures.<sup>65</sup>
                            The syndrome may develop with “normal” blood pressure and
                            may be undetectable by tomographic brain imaging.<sup>66</sup>
                            Ogasawara et al. (2003) found the incidence of SPECTconfirmed
                            pathologic post-endarterectomy hyperperfusion
                            to be 12%. These authors showed cerebral oximetry to
                            have 100% sensitivity and specificity in detecting this
                            hyperperfusion. Other investigators have reported on the
                            value of rSO<sub>2</sub> in detecting hyperperfusion accompanying
                            retrograde, or selective antegrade cerebral perfusion during
                            aortic arch surgery.<sup>11,49,67</sup></p>

                            <h5>Seizure Activity</h5>
                            <p>Cerebral vasoneural coupling ensures that local brain
metabolic increases normally are met with augmented
regional blood flow.<sup>68</sup> With intermittent episodes of intense
synaptic activation, brain rSO<sub>2</sub> trends recorded at the highest
(i.e., 5 s) update rate may oscillate because of onset-offset
variations in the hemodynamic coupling response
(Figure 15).<sup>69</sup> These rapidly oscillating rSO<sub>2</sub> trends have been
used successfully to detect seizure activity in chemically
paralyzed, ventilated patients and monitor patient response to
anticonvulsant therapy.<sup>70</sup> Clinically silent seizures occur
frequently in neurocritical care patients and, if left untreated,
may adversely affect outcome.<sup>71</sup></p>

                            <h5>Cerebral Vasospasm</h5>
                            <p>The presence of intracranial extravascular blood may trigger
arterial vasospasm. Resulting local hypoperfusion may disrupt
normal vasoneural coupling. As with seizure activity, the
destabilized hemodynamic response can then lead to
oscillation in rapidly updated rSO<sub>2</sub> trends.<sup>72</sup> INVOS
recordings from shaved scalp overlying a spastic arterial
segment successfully recorded vasospasm progression and
a subsequent positive therapeutic response.<sup>73</sup></p>
                            <h5>Intracranial Hypertension</h5>
                            <p>Cerebral rSO<sub>2</sub> is inversely related to intracranial pressure in
critical care patients with brain tumors, head trauma or
hydrocephalus.<sup>74</sup> In all three pathologic conditions,
intracranial hypertension is associated with a significant rSO<sub>2</sub>
reduction, signifying developing brain O<sub>2</sub>D. However, the
presence of intracranial extravascular blood may confound
this relationship because of infrared photon sequestration.
It should also be appreciated that rSO<sub>2</sub> values obtained from
dying or dead brain are typically very high because there is
little or no oxygen consumption.<sup>75</sup> This observation helps
explain the lack of a linear relationship between cerebral
blood flow and rSO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, large shifts in intracranial
photon scattering that accompany brain swelling may
profoundly alter rSO<sub>2</sub> in an unpredictable manner.</p>

                            <p>rSO<sub>2</sub> fluctuations may be observed with the INVOS monitor.
Variability in rSO<sub>2</sub> values when seen during a single
hemodynamic fluctuation, for example a change in blood
pressure, are not necessarily clinically significant however;
specific consideration should be given to a large decrease
(i.e., >20%) or increase (i.e., >10%) in rSO<sub>2</sub> from a preprocedure
or other reference point. A systematic approach is
presented to guide detection and correction of noteworthy
brain oxygen imbalance. It remains an evolutionary process
that has emerged from earlier published algorithms.<sup>2,4,76-79</sup></p>

                            critical care environments to detect and correct regional brain
                            oxygen imbalance. It is important for clinicians to fully
                            appreciate the applications, limitations and special
                            considerations for use of INVOS monitoring.</p>

                            clinical investigations provide an evidence-based rationale for
                            the incorporation of INVOS monitoring as a tool to facilitate
